Welcome to pygit2's documentation!
==================================

Pygit2 is a set of Python bindings to the libgit2 shared library, libgit2
implements the core of Git.  Pygit2 works with Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5,
3.6 and pypy.

It is likely to work with Python 2.6 and 3.1, but these versions are not
officially supported.
