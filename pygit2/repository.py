        Create a new reference "name" which points to an object or to another
        reference.

        Based on the type and value of the target parameter, this method tries
        to guess whether it is a direct or a symbolic reference.

        Keyword arguments:

        force
            If True references will be overridden, otherwise (the default) an
            exception is raised.

        Examples::

            repo.create_reference('refs/heads/foo', repo.head.hex)
            repo.create_reference('refs/tags/foo', 'refs/heads/master')
