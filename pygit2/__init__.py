    """
    Clones a new Git repository from *url* in the given *path*.

    **bare** indicates whether a bare git repository should be created.

    **remote_name** is the name given to the "origin" remote.
    The default is "origin".

    **push_url** is a URL to be used for pushing.
    None means use the *url* parameter.

    **fetch_spec** defines the the default fetch spec.
    None results in the same behavior as *GIT_REMOTE_DEFAULT_FETCH*.

    **push_spec** is the fetch specification to be used for pushing.
    None means use the same spec as for *fetch_spec*.

    **checkout_branch** gives the name of the branch to checkout.
    None means use the remote's *HEAD*.

    Returns a Repository class pointing to the newly cloned repository.

    If you wish to use the repo, you need to do a checkout for one of
    the available branches, like this:

        >>> repo = repo.clone_repository("url", "path")
        >>> repo.checkout(branch)  # i.e.: refs/heads/master
