    Clones a new Git repository from *url* in the given *path*.

    **bare** indicates whether a bare git repository should be created.

    **remote_name** is the name given to the "origin" remote.
    The default is "origin".

    **push_url** is a URL to be used for pushing.
    None means use the *url* parameter.

    **fetch_spec** defines the the default fetch spec.
    None results in the same behavior as *GIT_REMOTE_DEFAULT_FETCH*.

    **push_spec** is the fetch specification to be used for pushing.
    None means use the same spec as for *fetch_spec*.

    **checkout_branch** gives the name of the branch to checkout.
    None means use the remote's *HEAD*.

    **ssh_pubkey** specifies the public key for ssh key authentication.
    Note that you must specify both public and private keys to enable
    public key authentication.
    None means public key authentication will not be used.

    **ssh_privkey** specifies the private key for ssh key authentication.
    Note that you must specify both public and private keys to enable
    public key authentication.
    None means public key authentication will not be used.

    **ssh_passphrase** The passphrase, if required, for public key
    authentication. If the keypair does not use a passphrase, this can
    be left set to None.

    Returns a Repository class pointing to the newly cloned repository.

    If you wish to use the repo, you need to do a checkout for one of
    the available branches, like this:

        >>> repo = repo.clone_repository("url", "path")
        >>> repo.checkout(branch)  # i.e.: refs/heads/master
